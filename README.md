##Algorithms in Ruby

This file contains implementations of Algorithms assigned in Stanford's [Algorithm Design and Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) specialization on Coursera

Each algorithm can be found in a unique file. There are also automated tests in RSpec included in these files.

####Algorithms

1. Binary Search, needs an rspec file. Not for class, just for fun. 
2. week1- Recursive Multiplication and Karatsuba Multiplication
3. week2- Number of Inversions in list of integers
4. week3- Quicksort implementation (including with very large input)
5. week4- Linear time implementation of selecting an nth-order statistic from an array, and Karger's minimum cut algorithm
6. week5- Strongly-connected components algorithm
7. week6- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
8. week7- Heaps,and Heap-based Dijkstra shortest path algorithm
9. week8- Three different implementations of the two-sum algorithm: naive, with a hash table, and with a bloom filter
